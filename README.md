# Create: Stuff 'N Additions - Tank Fix

A simple mod that fixes and adds integrations for the tanks from [Create: Stuff 'N Additions](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpss://modrinth.com/mod/create-stuff-additions) for NeoForge 1.21.1.

## Features

* **Spout Filling:** Fixes the Create: SA tanks by registering NeoForge fluid capabilities, allowing them to be filled by Create's Spout, pipes, and other fluid-moving blocks (1000mb at a time).

* **Sophisticated Core Integration (Optional):** Adds full support for [Sophisticated Core's](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpss://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-core) Tank Upgrade. This feature is automatically enabled when Sophisticated Core is installed, allowing the upgrade to fill and drain Create: SA tanks at high speed inside [Sophisticated Storage](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpss://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-storage) containers and [Sophisticated Backpacks](https://www.google.com/search?q=httpss://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-backpacks).

* **Curios Tank Slot:** Adds a custom "Tank" Curios slot, allowing the Create: SA tanks to be equipped as a bauble (if Curios is installed).
