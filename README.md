# Create: Stuff 'N Additions - Tank Fix
Simple Mod that adds back the ability to fill [Create SA](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-stuff-additions) Tanks With a Spout for Neoforge 1.21.1.
This mod works by registering NeoForge capabilities for the tanks so they can be spouted, and adds the behavior to increment their filling amount (100mb at a time).

It also adds a custom **Curios tank slot** so Create Stuff 'N Additions tanks can be equipped as Curios items when supported.
