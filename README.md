# Create Stuff and Addition Tank Fix
Simple Mod that adds back the ability to fill [Create SA](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-stuff-additions) Tanks With a Spout for Neoforge 1.21.1.
This mod works by registering NeoForge capabilities for the tanks so they can be spouted, and adds the behavior to increment their filling amount (100mb at a time).
